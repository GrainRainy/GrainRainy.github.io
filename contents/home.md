#### News

* I‚Äôm actively looking for Machine Learning System and O1/MLsys/LLM <strong style="color:red;"><strong>Research Opportunity.</strong></strong> <strong><strong>This includes</strong></strong> 
    * Train more powerful reasoning models like [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) and [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview). 
    * Improve RLHF training frameworks in the direction of reinforcement learning (such as [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF)).
    * Develop robust inference frameworks like [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).

If you need a reliable teammate who is familiar with <strong style="color:red;"><strong>both NLP and computer systems </strong></strong> with <strong style="color:red;"><strong>extensive industry experiences</strong></strong>, feel free to <a href="#contact-info">Contact Me</a>!


#### Biography

I'm a freshman of NJU, majoring in software engineering.

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions to AGI (<strong style="color:red;"><strong>Now I am interested in O1-like models ML Infra</strong></strong>), this includes:

1. <strong><strong>Machine Learning System</strong></strong> 
    * Training: Design more effective training system and algorithms, example includes [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).
    * Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT): Improve LoRA-like architecture and low bit model compression. example includes [IAPT](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.771.pdf). 
    * Long context inference: example includes [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention).
2. <strong><strong>LLM & LLM applications</strong></strong> 
    * CodeLLM
    * Foundation LLM (Yi-lightning)
    * RAG (GraphRAG): Examples includes [PaperHelper](https://github.com/JerryYin777/PaperHelper).
