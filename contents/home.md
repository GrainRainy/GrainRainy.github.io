#### Biography

I'm a freshman of NJU, majoring in software engineering.

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions to AGI (<strong style="color:red;"><strong>Now I am interested in O1-like models ML Infra</strong></strong>), this includes:

1. <strong><strong>Machine Learning System</strong></strong> 
    * Training: Design more effective training system and algorithms, example includes [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).
    * Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT): Improve LoRA-like architecture and low bit model compression. example includes [IAPT](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.771.pdf). 
    * Long context inference: example includes [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention).
2. <strong><strong>LLM & LLM applications</strong></strong> 
    * CodeLLM
    * Foundation LLM (Yi-lightning)
    * RAG (GraphRAG): Examples includes [PaperHelper](https://github.com/JerryYin777/PaperHelper).
