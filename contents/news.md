    * Train more powerful reasoning models like [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) and [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview). 
    * Improve RLHF training frameworks in the direction of reinforcement learning (such as [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF)).
    * Develop robust inference frameworks like [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
